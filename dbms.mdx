# Database System Overview and Concepts

### Database System vs. File System
- **File System:**
  - Data is stored in separate files.
  - Lack of a centralized control mechanism.
  - Data redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Difficult to perform complex queries.
  - Poor security and data integrity.

- **Database System:**
  - Data is stored in a structured and centralized manner.
  - Reduces data redundancy using normalization.
  - Ensures data consistency and integrity.
  - Supports complex queries through SQL.
  - Provides better security and access control.

### Database System Concepts and Architecture
- **Database System:** A collection of related data (database) and a set of programs to manage and access that data (DBMS).
- **Architecture:**
  - **Three-Tier Architecture:**
    1. **Internal Level:** Physical storage of data.
    2. **Conceptual Level:** Logical structure and relationships.
    3. **External Level:** User views.

### Data Model, Schema, and Instances
- **Data Model:** Defines how data is structured and manipulated. Examples: Relational, Hierarchical, Network, Object-Oriented.
- **Schema:** Logical description of the entire database structure.
  - **Physical Schema:** Details how data is stored.
  - **Logical Schema:** Describes the logical structure.
  - **View Schema:** Defines the user-specific views.
- **Instances:** The actual data at a specific point in time.

### Data Independence
- **Logical Data Independence:** Changes in logical schema do not affect external schemas.
- **Physical Data Independence:** Changes in physical schema do not affect logical schema.

### Database Languages and Interfaces
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines database schema. Example: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Manipulates data. Example: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Manages permissions. Example: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Manages transactions. Example: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.

### Overall Database Structure
- Components:
  - **Storage Manager:** Handles data storage and retrieval.
  - **Query Processor:** Interprets and executes queries.
  - **Transaction Manager:** Ensures data consistency.
  - **Database Administrator (DBA):** Responsible for managing and maintaining the database.

# Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

### ER Model Concepts
- **Entity:** An object or thing in the real world. Example: `Student`, `Course`.
- **Entity Set:** A collection of similar entities.
- **Attributes:** Properties of an entity. Example: `Name`, `Age`.
  - **Types:** Simple, Composite, Derived, Multi-Valued.
- **Relationships:** Association among entities. Example: `Enrolls` (between `Student` and `Course`).

### Notation for ER Diagram
- **Entity:** Represented by a rectangle.
- **Attributes:** Represented by ovals.
- **Relationships:** Represented by diamonds.
- **Primary Key:** Underlined attribute.

### Mapping Constraints
- **Cardinality Ratios:**
  - **1:1 (One-to-One)**
  - **1:N (One-to-Many)**
  - **M:N (Many-to-Many)**
- **Participation:**
  - **Total Participation:** All entities participate in the relationship.
  - **Partial Participation:** Some entities participate in the relationship.

### Keys
- **Super Key:** A set of attributes uniquely identifying a row.
- **Candidate Key:** Minimal super key.
- **Primary Key:** A chosen candidate key.

### Generalization and Aggregation
- **Generalization:** Combining similar entities into a generalized entity.
- **Aggregation:** Treating a relationship as an abstract entity.

### Reduction of ER Diagrams to Tables
- Convert entities and their attributes to tables.
- Represent relationships using foreign keys.
- Handle complex constraints explicitly.

### Extended ER Model
- Enhances the basic ER model with concepts like:
  - **Specialization:** Subclassing entities.
  - **Generalization:** Combining subclasses.

### Relationship of Higher Degree
- **Binary Relationships:** Involve two entities.
- **Ternary Relationships:** Involve three entities.
- **N-ary Relationships:** Involve `n` entities.
